## Abstract

Most existing multi-view representation learning methods assume view-completeness and noise-free data. However, such assumptions are strong in real-world applications. Although individual methods have been tailored to suit view-missing or noise problems, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to addressing both cases together. To this end, we propose a holistic method, called Dual-masked Variational Autoencoders (DualVAE), which aims at learning robust multi-view representation. The DualVAE exhibits an innovative amalgamation of dual-masked prediction, mixture-of-experts learning, representation disentangling, and a joint loss function in wrapping up all components. The key novelty lies in the dual-masked (view-mask and patch-mask) mechanism to mimic missing view and noisy data. Extensive experiments on four multi-view datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superior performance in comparison to baselines.

## Data preparation

Before running experiments, your datasets should be organized as:

```
DualVAE 
├───MyData
│   └───coil-20
│   └───coil-100
│   └───EdgeMNISTDataset
│   └───PolyMNIST
├───configs
...
```

## Training step

First switch to the root directory of the project, then run the command :

```pyth
python train.py -f [config file]
```

After trained, a new weight file can be found in directory  `/experiments`

## Evaluation step

First fill in the path of pretrained model to `eval.model_path` domain in corresponding config file.

Then run the command:

```
python eval.py -f [config file]
```

Our pretrained models on four datasets are available at  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1npR7RgA3-7Hg8pkVVn7PRds0Xy9CHBm5?usp=sharing)
